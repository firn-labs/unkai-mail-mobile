//! Calendar + event cache and sync-state persistence.
//!
//! The shapes here mirror the CalDAV layer's outputs, but live in
//! their own structs (`CalendarRow`, `CalendarEventRow`) so this
//! crate doesn't have to depend on `unkai-caldav`. The Tauri layer
//! maps between the two — the same pattern we use for contacts.
//!
//! # What gets stored where
//!
//! - `calendars` — one row per remote calendar. Carries the RFC 6578
//!   `sync_token` and Nextcloud's `ctag` so the next app launch can
//!   do an incremental sync instead of a full re-fetch.
//!
//! - `calendar_events` — one row per VEVENT. A single CalDAV href can
//!   carry a master plus several recurrence-id overrides; we unfold
//!   those into separate rows that all share `(calendar_id, uid)` and
//!   are distinguished by `recurrence_id` (NULL for the master, the
//!   original occurrence's epoch seconds for an override).
//!
//! # Why we keep `ics_raw`
//!
//! Same reasoning as contacts: if we later surface more iCalendar
//! fields (ATTENDEE, ORGANIZER, VALARM…) we can re-extract them from
//! the cached blob without re-syncing every event. The recurrence
//! expander in `unkai_caldav::expand` also benefits — it can
//! cross-check a row's parsed `rrule` / `exdate` against the raw
//! source if anything ever looks off.
