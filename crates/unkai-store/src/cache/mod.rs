//! Local mail cache backed by SQLite.
//!
//! # What lives here
//!
//! - **Envelopes** (light metadata shown in the mail list) and **bodies**
//!   (text/HTML, cached lazily on first open) of messages fetched from IMAP.
//! - **Folder listings** and **per-folder sync state** so the next launch
//!   can start displaying something before the network is touched.
//!
//! # What does not live here
//!
//! - **Passwords**: always in the OS keychain (`credentials.rs`). Never
//!   the DB, never disk.
//!
//! # Read strategy
//!
//! The UI loads from the cache first (instant, offline-safe) and then
//! kicks off a network refresh which write-throughs back to the cache.
//! The Tauri layer owns this dance — there are separate `get_cached_*`
//! commands for the cache path and `fetch_*` commands for the network
//! path. Keeping them distinct makes the strategy explicit in the UI
//! and lets future views (search, notifications) pick whichever they
//! need.
//!
//! # Thread-safety
//!
//! The cache holds an `r2d2` pool internally. Every method checks out a
//! connection, does its work, and returns it. The pool is internally
//! synchronised so `Cache` is cheap to `clone()` and share across tasks.

    // stay queued and the periodic background-sync drain retries
    // them.  Surfaces in the UI as a synthetic "Outbox" folder

    // non-empty.
