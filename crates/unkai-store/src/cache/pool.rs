//! Connection pool and PRAGMA tuning for the local mail cache.
//!
//! SQLite is a single-file embedded database. "Scaling" it means choosing
//! sane PRAGMAs and serialising writes; the library choice matters less
//! than those. The settings below are the standard high-throughput
//! desktop-app recipe:
//!
//! - **`PRAGMA key`** — SQLCipher's unlock pragma. MUST be the first
//!   statement on every connection, before any query touches the DB.
//!   The key is a 32-byte raw binary value, passed as `x'<hex>'` so
//!   SQLCipher skips PBKDF2 derivation (we already have CSPRNG bytes).
//!
//! - **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** — readers never block writers and vice
//!   versa. Without WAL, every write takes an exclusive lock on the whole
//!   DB, which would freeze the UI while the sync thread writes envelopes.
//!
//! - **`synchronous = NORMAL`** — WAL is checkpointed at shutdown rather
//!   than on every commit. Safe (we still survive crashes, just not a
//!   hard OS-level power loss mid-commit) and dramatically faster.
//!
//! - **`busy_timeout = 5000ms`** — if a second connection finds the write
//!   lock held, wait up to 5s instead of failing immediately. This papers
//!   over brief contention between the sync thread and a UI query.
//!
//! - **`foreign_keys = ON`** — SQLite ignores FK constraints by default;
//!   we want `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `message_bodies` to actually fire.
//!
//! # Why r2d2
//!
//! A pool lets N reader connections run concurrently against a WAL
//! database — useful once we start doing searches or background sync
//! while the UI is also pulling envelopes. One pool, shared by the
//! whole app, created once at startup.
