//! Contacts cache and sync-state persistence.
//!
//! The shapes here mirror the CardDAV layer's outputs, but kept in
//! their own struct (`ContactRow`) so the store crate doesn't have to
//! depend on `unkai-carddav`. The Tauri layer converts between the
//! two — a tiny field-for-field map.
//!
//! # Why store the raw vCard
//!
//! Two reasons:
//!
//! 1. **Forward-compat**: when we later want to expose more vCard
//!    fields (birthday, addresses, categories), we can re-extract
//!    them from the cached row without re-syncing every contact from
//!    the server. Important on big address books.
//! 2. **Round-trip safety**: if we ever add edit support, we need the
//!    exact vCard text we last sent so we can produce a sensible diff
//!    instead of regenerating from a lossy projection.
