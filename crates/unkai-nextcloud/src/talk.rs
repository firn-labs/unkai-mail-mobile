//! Nextcloud Talk (spreed) integration — list and create Talk rooms,
//! and add participants to existing rooms.
//!
//! # Endpoint shape
//!
//! Talk lives under the OCS API at `/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v4/`.
//! All calls share the same OCS etiquette as `shares.rs`:
//! `OCS-APIRequest: true` + `Accept: application/json`, Basic auth
//! with the app password, and an envelope of the form
//!
//! ```json
//! { "ocs": { "meta": { ... }, "data": { ... } } }
//! ```
//!
//! On success `data` is the payload object (or array, for `list_rooms`).
//! On failure `data` is typically `[]` and the failure code lives in
//! `meta.statuscode` *even though HTTP itself returned 200* — same
//! pattern shares.rs has to handle.
//!
//! # MVP scope (issue #13)
//!
//! Three operations, enough to power "create a Talk room from an email
//! thread", "list rooms in the sidebar", and "share the room link":
//!
//! - [`list_rooms`] — every room the user is a participant of.
//! - [`create_room`] — create a group room with an arbitrary set of
//!   participants (Nextcloud users *and* email-only invitees).
//! - [`add_participant`] — used internally by `create_room`, but
//!   exposed so callers can also extend an existing room.
//! - [`rename_room`] — used by the Compose "Add Event" flow so the
//!   Talk room created up-front (with the email subject as a
//!   placeholder name) can be renamed to match the final event title
//!   the user typed in the editor.
//!
//! Editing the rest of room settings (set password / promote
//! moderator) is left to a future issue — the Talk web UI handles
//! those and Unkai opens rooms in the browser anyway.
