//! Application state, free of any Tauri `State<T>` wrapper (#476).
//!
//! Since #533 the per-profile pieces ([`AppContext`] and the types it
//! bundles) live inside the desktop shell's `ProfileRegistry`, one
//! set per profile, resolved per window — only genuinely
//! machine-global state (the system-font cache) is still handed to
//! `Builder::manage` directly.  Nothing here knows either way.
