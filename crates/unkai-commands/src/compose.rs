///    would just clutter the user's mailbox.  Matches the inline
///    expunge the `save_draft` replace path uses for the same
///    reason.
///
/// 2. **Keeps the tombstone on IMAP failure.**  `delete_message`
///    clears `pending_action` on real failures so the row reappears
///    on the next poll — which is correct for a delete that the
///    user can retry from the visible list, but produces the
