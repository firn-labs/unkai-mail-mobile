//! The one seam between the application layer and whatever shell is
//! driving it (#476).
//!
//! Everything in this crate is transport-agnostic, but plenty of it
//! still needs to *tell the user something happened* — new mail
//! landed, the outbox drained, a reminder came due.  Under Tauri that
//! was `AppHandle::emit("new-mail", …)`, which dragged a Tauri type
//! into every function that wanted to speak.  Here it is a trait
//! instead: the desktop crate implements `UiNotifier` on top of
//! `AppHandle`, a test implements it as a `Vec` of recorded calls,
//! and a future headless deployment implements it however it likes.
//!
//! Two groups of methods:
//!
//! * **push events** — the direct replacements for the old `emit`
//!   channels.  Each one carries the same payload struct the frontend
//!   already deserialises, so the wire format is unchanged.
//! * **native chrome** — tray badge, taskbar overlay, app icon.  These
//!   have no frontend event; they exist because "reflect the unread
//!   count in the UI" genuinely means painting a tray icon on desktop
//!   and may mean nothing at all elsewhere.
//!
//! Implementations are expected to be **best-effort and infallible**:
//! a dropped notification is a cosmetic loss (the user refreshes and
//! sees the truth), so the methods return `()` and swallow their own
//! transport errors rather than making 40 call sites handle a failure
//! they can do nothing about.  Two methods are deliberate exceptions —
//! `apply_logo_style` validates its input, and `message_reminder`
//! gates a cache write on the push having landed; both document why.
