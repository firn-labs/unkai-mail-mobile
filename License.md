# Third-Party Licenses

Unkai Mail is licensed under [**GPL-3.0**](LICENSE). The compiled
binary bundles, statically links, or otherwise relies on the
third-party software listed below. Each item is governed by its
own license, reproduced or referenced inline.

This file is the **legal attribution document** — what we ship next
to the binary so each upstream's notice obligations are met. For the
broader discussion of what each licence type forces our distribution
model to look like (sell binaries / closed-source fork / dual-licence
options), see [SBOM.md](SBOM.md).

The full direct-dependency inventory is in [SBOM.md](SBOM.md); this
file groups the same packages by licence so that each notice block
applies to every package listed underneath it.

## Apache License 2.0

The following are available under Apache-2.0 (either exclusively or as
the alternate half of an `MIT OR Apache-2.0` dual-licence — we may
choose either, and choose Apache-2.0 here for transitive compatibility
with downstream consumers who require it):

**Rust crates**: `serde`, `thiserror`, `anyhow`, `reqwest`, `chrono`,
`chrono-tz`, `dirs`, `keyring`, `r2d2`, `r2d2_sqlite`, `getrandom`,
`hex`, `async-imap`, `futures`, `rustls`, `tokio-rustls`,
`rustls-pki-types`, `mail-parser`, `ical`, `base64`, `aes-gcm`,
`pbkdf2`, `hmac`, `uuid`, `hickory-resolver`,
`pgp` (rpgp), `rand`, `openssl`, `zeroize`, `rmcp`, `tauri`,
`tauri-build`, `tauri-plugin-notification`, `tauri-plugin-dialog`,
`tauri-plugin-opener`.

**Vendored libraries**: OpenSSL (statically linked through
`rusqlite`'s `bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl` feature for the
SQLCipher build, and through the `openssl` crate's `vendored` feature
for the S/MIME / CMS path added in #338).

**npm packages**: `dompurify` (alternate half of `MPL-2.0 OR
Apache-2.0`), `typescript`.

> **Removed in the iOS port (2026-09-01).** The desktop shell's
> platform plugins and editors are no longer part of this app and
> their notices no longer ship: `font-kit`, `open`,
> `tauri-plugin-autostart`, `tauri-plugin-deep-link`,
> `tauri-plugin-single-instance`, `tauri-plugin-updater`,
> `notify-rust`, `tauri-winrt-notification`, `windows`, `gtk`, and on
> the npm side the `@tiptap/*` and `@codemirror/*` families,
> `svelte-tiptap`, `emoji-picker-element`,
> `@tauri-apps/plugin-autostart`, `@tailwindcss/typography` and
> `@types/dompurify`. All were permissive; removing them frees no
> obligation, it only shortens this file.

The full Apache License 2.0 text is reproduced at:
<https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt>

Apache-2.0 requires:
- Reproduction of the licence and any `NOTICE` file from the
  upstream package alongside the binary.
- Preservation of all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
  notices.
- Marking modified files with a "Modified by" notice.

When we ship a binary bundle, this `License.md` file together with
each upstream's preserved `LICENSE` / `NOTICE` text inside its source
package satisfies the reproduction requirement.

## BSD-3-Clause License

**Rust crates**: `subtle` (constant-time comparison for the MCP
bearer-token check, #438; copyright (c) 2016-2017 Isis Agora
Lovecruft and Henry de Valence). The licence text below is the
same BSD-3-Clause template with the respective copyright holder
substituted; `subtle`'s full notice ships in its Cargo source
package as fetched at build time.

**Vendored library**: SQLCipher Community Edition — statically linked
into the binary via `rusqlite`'s
`bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl` feature. Provides the encrypted
local mail cache.

## bzip2 License

**Rust crates**: `libbz2-rs-sys` (the pure-Rust bzip2 implementation
reached transitively via `bzip2` → `pgp`, which uses it for OpenPGP
compressed-data packets).

A permissive BSD-style licence (`bzip2-1.0.6` on SPDX) — same shape as
the 4-clause BSD with attribution, no-misrepresentation, and
no-endorsement clauses. No copyleft, no commercial restriction; we just
preserve the notice below.

```
This program, the associated library "libbzip2", and all documentation,
are Copyright (C) 1996-2021 Julian R Seward, Copyright (C) 2019-2020

## Zlib License

**Rust crates**: `objc2`, `objc2-foundation`, `block2`,
`objc2-event-kit`, `objc2-contacts`, `objc2-core-graphics`,
`objc2-core-foundation` — the Objective-C runtime bindings the
`unkai-system` crate uses to read and write the device's own
Calendar, Reminders and Contacts databases (EventKit + Contacts),
plus the CoreGraphics colour accessor that reads a system calendar's
own colour.

All seven are published by the [objc2 project](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2)
under **Zlib OR Apache-2.0 OR MIT**. We may take any of the three; the
Zlib text is reproduced here because it is the licence the project
lists first and the only one of the three not already represented
above. Note that these are *bindings* — the EventKit, Contacts,
CoreGraphics and CoreFoundation frameworks themselves ship as part of
iOS and macOS, are dynamically linked, and are never redistributed by
us.

## ISC License

**Rust crates**: `rustls` (alternate half of `Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR
MIT`).

The ISC licence is functionally identical to the simplified BSD /
MIT permissive model with abbreviated wording.

## Mozilla Public License 2.0

The following are governed by MPL-2.0:

- **`webpki-roots`** (Rust crate) — Mozilla's curated list of trusted
  root CAs, bundled into the rustls trust store. Source:
  <https://github.com/rustls/webpki-roots>
- **`webpki-root-certs`** (Rust crate) — the same Mozilla root CA list
  as `webpki-roots`, but as full self-signed DER certificates, fed into
  an OpenSSL `X509Store` for S/MIME signature chain validation (#338).
  Source: <https://github.com/rustls/webpki-roots>
- **`dompurify`** (npm package) — HTML sanitiser used by the mail
  reader. Available as `MPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0`; we honour the MPL-2.0
  obligations as the more conservative choice. Source:
  <https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify>

MPL-2.0 is **file-level weak copyleft**. Modifications to MPL-licensed
*files* must be released under MPL, but new files we add ourselves
stay under our own licence. We do not modify any of these
dependencies — we consume them as published — so we do not generate
any source obligations beyond preserving the original licence headers,
which Cargo / npm already do at install time.

If you ship a binary built from this repository, you must:
- Make the source of the MPL-licensed files available on request.
- Preserve every copyright notice in the upstream source archive.

The full MPL-2.0 text is at: <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/>

## GNU General Public License v3

- **`rrule`** (Rust crate) — RFC 5545 recurrence-rule expansion engine,
  used by `unkai-caldav` to materialise recurring calendar events
  into concrete occurrences. Source:
  <https://github.com/fmeringdal/rust-rrule>
- **Unkai Mail itself** is licensed under GPL-3.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)
  in the repository root). The presence of `rrule` in the dependency
  tree is the load-bearing reason — every binary we distribute must be
  accompanied by source under GPL-3.0 or a compatible licence.

GPL-3.0 is **strong viral copyleft**. Distributing a binary that
links to GPL-3.0 code requires:
- Distributing the complete corresponding source, or making it
  available via a written offer that any recipient can act on for at
  least three years. Our public GitHub repository at
  <https://github.com/firn-labs/unkai-mail-mobile> serves as that
  availability.
- Preserving copyright notices.
- Licensing any work that combines with GPL-3.0 code under GPL-3.0
  itself.

The full GPL-3.0 text is in the repository root [LICENSE](LICENSE)
file and at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>.

## CC0-1.0 (runtime data feeds)

The link-safety check (#165) consumes the **URLhaus** malicious-URL
feed published by [abuse.ch](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/). The data
itself is dedicated to the public domain under
[CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) — no
attribution clause forces redistribution semantics, and no
copyleft pressure spreads to the rest of Unkai. We still credit
abuse.ch in the Settings UI as a goodwill gesture: the project
runs on community contributions and a visible "powered by" link
helps them keep funding the work.

The CC0-1.0 dedication does not impose any reproduction or notice
obligation. Reproduced here for completeness:

> CC0 1.0 Universal — The person who associated a work with this
> deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all
> of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law,
> including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent
> allowed by law.

## ring (TLS crypto provider)

`ring` is the cryptographic primitives library backing `rustls` (our
TLS implementation). It carries a custom multi-licence notice:

> ISC-style license with portions under Apache-2.0, BSD-style, and the
> OpenSSL Project's licence (the latter inherited from BoringSSL
> code).

The full notice is reproduced in the `ring` source archive at
<https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/LICENSE> and is shipped
inside the package's source distribution. By transitively including
all the constituent licences (ISC / BSD / Apache-2.0 / OpenSSL / SSLeay)
we satisfy the attribution obligation; none of these licences are
copyleft, so they impose no licence pressure on Unkai beyond
attribution preservation.

---

## How attribution is shipped

For source distribution (this repository) the relevant licence text
travels with each package's source under `~/.cargo/registry/src/...`
or `node_modules/...` after `cargo build` / `npm install`. No
additional bundling is required.

For binary releases (`cargo tauri build`), this `License.md` file
plus the per-package licences extracted by Cargo / npm at build time
are bundled inside the installer's `licenses/` directory (TODO when
the release pipeline is set up). The combined result satisfies every
upstream's reproduction-of-notice requirement.

---

## Updating this file

Whenever a dependency is added, removed, or upgraded:

1. Update [SBOM.md](SBOM.md) (the inventory + marketing-implications
   document — see the maintenance rule there).
2. Update this file: add the package to the appropriate licence
   section above, or create a new section if the licence isn't
   represented yet.
3. If the new dependency introduces a stronger copyleft licence than
   what's already present (e.g. AGPL-3.0), surface that as a project-
   level decision before merging — it changes our distribution model.
