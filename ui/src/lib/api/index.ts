/**
 * The UI's one door to the backend (#473).
 *
 * Usage in components:
 *
 *   import * as api from './api'            // from ui/src/lib/*
 *   import * as api from './lib/api'        // from ui/src/App.svelte
 *
 *   const envelopes = await api.mail.fetchEnvelopes({ accountId, folder, limit })
 *   const un = await api.onAppEvent('new-mail', (e) => { … })
 *
 * Domain namespaces mirror the backend's areas of responsibility;
 * the event helpers and their name registry live in `./events`;
 * platform affordances (the file picker, local notifications, asset
 * URLs) in `./platform`.
