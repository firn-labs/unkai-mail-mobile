/**
 * accountsStore — single source of truth for the mail-account list
 * (#534 cleanup, modeled on `contactsStore.svelte.ts`).
 *
 * The list used to live twice: as component `$state` in App.svelte
 * *and* re-fetched privately inside AccountSettings, kept in sync
 * through an `onaccountschanged` callback. Lifting it into a
 * `.svelte.ts` module gives every consumer the same reactive array —
 * and chunk 4's profile rail switcher (#535) re-loads exactly this
 * store when a window switches profiles.
 *
 * The store owns the *data*; it does not own selection. Which
 * account is active, and what happens to the selected folder when an
 * account disappears, stays App.svelte's concern.
